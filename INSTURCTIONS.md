Culminating Assignment – ICS 4U
Due Date: June 11th, 2024 (End of the Period)

In groups of 3-4 (preferably 4), create an ambitious project to demonstrate everything you have learned in this course.
Creating your program:
Your program must include everything we have learned as part of the grade 12 portion of the course.  This includes but is not limited to:
Classes
Searching (Binary/Sequential)
Inheritance
Sorting (Bubble/Selection/Insertion/Merge)
Abstract classes and interfaces
Recursion (where appropriate)
2-D arrays (Where appropriate)
Overloading and Overriding
Polymorphism
UML Diagrams.
File I/O




You will be marked in the following manner:
Part A: Proposal: (5%) - Due June 2th, 2024 
	Before you begin anything, find your group's members and come up with a proposal for your program.  This can range from a variety of things including games, databases, airport booking systems, library systems, improving the schools database etc.  Please try to create something that you are interested in and not just something you think will be easy. When you have an idea, make sure to okay it with Mr. Kalisz. This is all you need to do to get 5%.
Part B: UML (20%) - Due June 6th, 2024
	Once your proposal has been approved, create a UML class diagram of your program to better organize your group.  Your UML diagram does not have to go all out but should at least show the basic outline of your program.  It is okay if things change after this stage but this should be well thought out and a guide for your group. Remember, you will be marked on this so do your best.
Part C: Coding (75%) - June 11th, 2024 
	This should be the final step of your program.  Please remember to code with respect to all the different concepts we have covered this year and with proper coding style.  The rubric this will be assessed on is the same as the problem set. Comments, javadocs and documentation are a part of your code!  Feel free to go above and beyond and try new things that we haven’t covered in class including GUI.  This is by no means a requirement but you are encouraged to do your own research on things we haven’t covered.  Just make sure to use them appropriately. No AI Code!
	Most importantly, make your code robust.  I should not be able to break your code.  You have 3-4 very capable testers in your group, make sure to use them.  The rubric that your code will be marked against is included on the final page of this handout.  Good Luck!
