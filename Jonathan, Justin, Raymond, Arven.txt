You don't have an actual program that someone can run!
There also seem to be a lot of implementations missing that you had in your UML and didn't incorporate.
Polymorphism really was the key to success for this whole project, where displaying and viewing everything should be a simple UI that uses the classes to populate everything for them (players for different sports could populate the important information using hashmaps of their stats)
Otherwise it was really well done!  There is defintely a good framework here that just needs to be flushed out a little more.
